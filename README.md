# api.dantran.fr

Still a WIP.. future backend of https://dantran.fr (currently built with PHP)

Playing with the following stack:
* Python (FastAPI)
* MongoDB
* MinIO

Provided endpoints:
* `/music`

## Run locally

The following requirements must be installed on your local host:
* Docker Engine (only tested with v20.10.6)
* Docker Compose (only tested with v1.28.6)

### Development

Make sure the environment is clean:

```
$ docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml down
```

Build and run the environment (same command after changes):

```
$ docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Access to:
* Swagger UI: `https://<localhost|host_ip>:8000/docs`
* MinIO UI: `https://<localhost|host_ip>:9000/`

See logs:

```
$ docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml logs -f
```

Tear down the environment:

```
$ docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml down
```

### Tests

Make sure the environment is clean:

```
$ docker-compose -f test.docker-compose.yml down
```

Build and run tests, with logs:

```
$ docker-compose -f test.docker-compose.yml up --exit-code-from=test-app --build
```

Tear down the environment:

```
$ docker-compose -f test.docker-compose.yml down
```
